# Rust Chip-8 simulator
This is a Chip-8 simulator written in Rust using the Rust SDL2 bindings (https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2).

A few years ago I made another Chip-8 simulator in Rust based on a tutorial (I believe it was this one: https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book/tree/master). This one is mostly written from scratch, although I did use the old version as a reference at times. Another helpful resource was Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference (http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM). My main motivation for this rewrite was to brush up on my Rust skills since I haven't seriously used it in probably around a year.
